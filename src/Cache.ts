 * params" rather than its "URI and request headers", and cache directives are
 * provided as explicit arguments (not header strings). Similarly, it refers to
 * the "producer and consumer" of cached values, rather than the "server and the
 * client". Beyond renaming, it leaves open the set of available validators for
 * users to define (e.g., db row version numbers), rather than hard-coding HTTP
 * validators like etags and last-modified dates, and it supports a set of
 * directives somewhat more general than their HTTP equivalents.
 *
 * For (critical) background details on the HTTP caching model, see the docs.
 *
 * The cache is parameterized over a {@link ResourceTypes} registry, which
 * names each kind of resource the cache can hold and pairs it with a runtime
 * classifier for its id sub-space plus a (phantom) content type. The cache's
 * {@link CacheSpec} union is derived from the registry via {@link SpecOf}:
 * the get/store/getMany methods narrow the content type based on the id of
 * each request, and reject mismatched (id, content) pairs at compile time.
 * At runtime, every id the cache sees (requests, stored entries -- primary
 * and supplemental -- and deletes) is classified against the registry, and
 * ids that match zero or multiple resource types are loudly rejected.
 *
 * TODO: support the concept of warnings.

   *   allowed stale responses (sans revalidation) through the `maxStale`
   *   directive. If multiple cached values would've have been suitable, this
   *   holds the preferred one (which currently means the newest).
   *
   * - `usableWhileRevalidate`: this holds the preferred response (if any)
   *   that's usable to satisfy the client's request, but that must be
   *   (re-)validated in the background.
   *
   * - `usableIfError`: holds an entry (if any) that's usable only in case of an
   *   error reaching the producer while trying to fetch/revalidate the cached
   *   value. If there's a `usableWhileRevalidate` response, this key will
   *   always be empty [because the usableWhileRevalidate response should be
   *   returned before calling the producer, so there's no chance on an error.]
   *
   * - `validatable`: when validation is necessary (either because no usable
   *    response is held by the cache, or the usable response requires
   *    background re-validation), this array holds all entries in the cache
   *    that have validation info -- including, possibly, responses present in
   *    the other returned keys -- and that would be usable were the producer
   *    to confirm (revalidate) that the resource's current state matches the
   *    state identified by the validation info. Otherwise, this array is empty.
   *    These are returned so that the user can make a conditional request for
   *    the latest content that takes into account the validation info (e.g.,
   *    the etags w/ `If-None-Match`) of these saved responses. These responses
   *    are probably stale, but it's possible they're not (e.g., if consumer
   *    used a maxAge directive shorter than the producer's freshness lifetime).
   *
   * The result's content type is narrowed to the spec variants whose id is
   * compatible with `req.id`. So, e.g., if the cache's `Spec` is a union and
   * `req.id` is a literal that only matches one variant, callers don't have to
   * narrow the returned content themselves.
   *
   * Emits one `read` diagnostics message (see `CACHE_READ_CHANNEL_NAME`) per
   * call: the lookup result on success, or `found: "read-failed"` with the
   * error if the store threw (and then the error still propagates). An
   * *aborted* read emits nothing, matching the `throwIfAborted` fast path.

 * deliberately does not mention `Id`: its own spec is captured in
 * `StoreSupportedTypes` and merely *checked* for coverage, exactly as for a
 * hand-written registry (see {@link CacheOptions}' `store`). That buys two
 * things at once -- a general-purpose store can back a sole-type cache, and the
 * store stops competing with the guard as an inference site for `Id`. While it
 * did compete, an untyped `new MemoryStore()` won and silently collapsed `Id`
 * back to `string`, discarding the guard's narrowing.
 *
 * The intersected carrier is what keeps a narrower `Id` honest. `validateId`
 * has to be optional in the base object to serve as an inference site at all;
 * the carrier makes it REQUIRED as soon as `Id` is narrower than `string`. An
 * explicit type argument is fixed before the carrier resolves, so naming a
 * narrow `Id` without a guard is rejected -- and an *inferred* narrow `Id`
 * could only have come from a guard in the first place. So a narrower id space
 * always has a runtime check behind it. (The tuple brackets make this a
 * whole-set comparison rather than a distributive, member-by-member one.)
 *
 * Note that coverage is NOT checked here: it cannot be. The check has to
 * compare `CacheSpec<Id, Content>` against the store's spec, and a conditional
 * spelled over `Id` is resolved while checking the `store` property -- before
 * `validateId` has contributed its inference, since a type predicate's
 * narrowing lands in a later pass. It therefore resolves against `Id`'s default
 * of `string` and rejects every store typed more narrowly than that. (Probed:
 * a store typed for exactly the guard's id space failed its own coverage
 * check.) Coverage is left to `new Cache`, where `Id` is already fixed.

 * registry literal:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const cache = new Cache(singleTypeCacheOptions<Json>()({ store, name: "xyz-cache" }));
 * ```
 *
 * The resource type is named after the cache unless `resourceTypeName` says
 * otherwise. That name reaches diagnostics only -- it is never part of a store
 * key -- so naming it after the cache cannot invalidate entries, and it keeps
 * `resourceType` meaningful across caches instead of collapsing every
 * sole-type cache into one shared literal. Spread the result to add anything
 * else {@link CacheOptions} accepts.
 *
 * Curried for the same reason {@link resourceType} is: `Content` cannot be
 * inferred from anything, so it must be given explicitly, and TS has no partial
 * type-argument inference.
 *
 * As with a hand-written registry, the store only has to support *at least*
 * this cache's resource type, so a general-purpose store can back a sole-type
 * cache. Coverage is checked by `new Cache`; see {@link CacheOptions}' `store`.
 *
 * ## Narrowing the id space
 *
 * By default the sole type accepts every id, so the id space is `string`. Pass
 * `validateId` to narrow it. It is a REAL runtime guard, not a type assertion,
 * so a nonconforming id throws `UnclassifiableIdError` before the store is
 * touched:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const cache = new Cache(
 *   singleTypeCacheOptions<Schema>()({
 *     store: new MemoryStore(),
 *     name: "tickets",
 *     validateId: idStartsWith("ticket:"),
 *   }),
 * );
 * // cache.get({ id: "ticket:1", ... })  // ok
 * // cache.get({ id: "nope", ... })      // compile error
 * ```
 *
 * The guard is *required* as soon as `Id` is narrower than `string` (see
 * {@link SingleTypeCacheOptionsBuilder}), so a narrower id space always has a
 * runtime check behind it.
 *
 * ## What writing the registry by hand still buys
 *
 * This sugar's registry is keyed by an index signature, because the type's name
 * is a runtime value the caller asked not to think about. Two consequences,
 * both of which the hand-written form avoids:
 *
 * - `classify()` returns `string` rather than the type's literal name.
 * - `ResourceTypeName` of that registry is `string` too, so the compile-time
 *   check that a {@link producerByIdType} record's keys are real registry names
 *   cannot fire. A misspelled key is accepted at compile time and then throws
 *   `NoProducerForResourceTypeError` on every request. On a hand-written
 *   registry the same typo is a compile error.
 *
 * So prefer the hand-written one-entry registry when you use `producerByIdType`
 * or want the literal name; the sugar is for the common case of one resource
 * type and one bare producer function:
 *
 * ```ts
 * new Cache({
 *   store,
 *   name: "tickets",
 *   resourceTypes: {
 *     tickets: resourceType<Schema>()({ matches: idStartsWith("ticket:") }),
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
