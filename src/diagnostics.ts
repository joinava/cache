/**
 * @fileoverview The package's diagnostics channels. There are four:
 *
 * - `@zingage/cache:read` -- what did a cache lookup find? Published by
 *   `Cache.get`/`Cache.getMany` (including direct callers that never touch a
 *   wrapper).
 * - `@zingage/cache:fetch` -- how was a logical wrapped-producer request
 *   answered? Published by the producer wrappers, once per call of the
 *   wrapped function (per request element, for bulk), at settlement.
 * - `@zingage/cache:produce` -- one message per actual producer invocation
 *   (foreground misses AND background revalidations). Producer latency and
 *   error rate live here.
 * - `@zingage/cache:store-entry` -- one message per entry passed to
 *   `Cache.store()`.
 *
 * Every message carries the same two attribution fields ({@link Attribution};
 * `produce` carries them per element of `requests[]` instead): the cache
 * instance's `name` and the resource-type name from the cache's registry.
 *
 * ## `vary`: the slot key shared by `read`, `fetch`, and `store-entry`
 *
 * A cache's unit of storage is the `(id, vary)` SLOT, not the id: a producer
 * that varies on request params writes one entry per variant under the same
 * id. So `resourceId` alone is not enough to line a serve up with the store
 * that produced the value it served -- on a varying producer every variant's
 * serves would be credited to whichever variant stored first. The three
 * channels that can name a slot therefore all report the same normalized
 * `vary` object: `store-entry` for the entry written, and `read`/`fetch` for
 * the entry a lookup SELECTED. Where no entry was selected the key is OMITTED,
 * never published as `{}` -- `{}` is a real slot (the one a non-varying
 * producer writes), so conflating it with "unknown" would silently merge those
 * two populations. `produce` has no `vary`: an invocation is a request to the
 * origin, and which slot(s) its result occupies isn't known until it returns.
 *
 * ## Why `fetch` and `produce` are two channels, not one
 *
 * They are the two spans of the same story with different subjects and
 * cardinalities: a `fetch` is the consumer-side span (one per logical
 * request); a `produce` is the origin-side span (one per producer
 * invocation). They relate many-to-one in two ways -- request collapsing (N
 * callers ride 1 invocation; inlining invocation stats into fetch messages
 * would republish them once per rider, weighting producer error/latency
 * metrics by rider count) and bulk batching (one invocation covers
 * `requests[]`) -- and are temporally decoupled in two ways: a
 * stale-while-revalidate revalidation settles *after* its triggering fetch
 * event already shipped, and an `aborted` fetch settles *before* its
 * invocation does (the collapsed producer call keeps running and stores in
 * the background). The durations also mean different things:
 * `produce.durationMs` is invocation time, while any fetch-level duration
 * would be caller wait (riders wait less than the invocation took).
