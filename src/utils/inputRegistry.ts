/**
 * A reference-counted registry mapping a derived cache id back to the input it
 * was hashed from, so a computing producer can recover the input on a miss.
 * Used internally by the computing-producer wrappers (see
 * {@link wrapComputingProducer}).
 *
 * Reference counting (rather than a plain set/delete) is required because of
 * request collapsing: several concurrent calls for the same input derive the
 * same id and may share a single producer call. If the first caller to settle
 * deleted the entry, a still-in-flight caller (or the shared producer call)
 * could find it missing. Each call `acquire`s on the way in and `release`s in a
 * `finally`; the entry is dropped only when the last holder releases it. This
 * keeps the map bounded (unlike a process-lifetime map), since nothing is
 * retained past the calls that need it.
 *
 * Soundness of "release after the wrapped call settles": the underlying
 * `wrapProducer`/`wrapBulkProducer` invoke the producer *synchronously* while
 * the wrapped call is still running (including the fire-and-forget
 * stale-while-revalidate refresh), and our internal producer reads the input as
 * its first, synchronous step — so the read always happens before the release.
