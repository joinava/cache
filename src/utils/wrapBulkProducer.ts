/**
 * Fundamentally, this function takes a bulk producer that returns values for
 * multiple requests (likely without the help of a cache), and returns a
 * function that's a drop-in replacement for it, except that it tries to
 * lookup and reuse prior results from a cache using `Cache.getMany`, before
 * calling the underlying user-provided producer only for those requests that
 * could not be resolved from the cache (or that need revalidation later).
 *
 * Like {@link wrapProducer} (see its docs for the shared contracts: the single
 * producer function and how `Covered` is inferred, the producer purity
 * contract, and bypass requests skipping the cache read), exactly ONE producer
 * function is passed.
 *
 * That is what gives this wrapper its defining bulk capability: a bare
 * function covers the whole registry and is handed the **full** set of
 * requests it must produce, mixed resource types and all, in ONE call -- so it
 * can optimize across them (a single upstream call covering several types,
 * cross-type dedup, a join). Per-type dispatch is available as opt-in sugar via
 * {@link bulkProducerByIdType}, which splits the batch by classified type,
 * calls each sub-producer once with its own slice, and reassembles the results
 * positionally.
 *
 * A single `reqs` array passed to the wrapped function may freely mix covered
 * types; ids of uncovered types are compile errors per element (and, via casts,
 * throw `NoProducerForResourceTypeError` before any cache read -- only when
 * coverage was actually narrowed; see that error's docs in wrapProducer.ts).
 *
 * Note that this can call the underlying producer up to twice per wrapped
 * call: once for requests that had no immediately-usable cached values
 * (including bypass requests, which skip the read), and once (in the
 * background) for requests that had usableWhileRevalidate results and need to
 * be revalidated in the background.
 *
 * Note that any supplemental resources returned by a producer will be
 * cached but not returned to the caller.
 *
 * The wrapped function is generic over the specific ids of incoming requests
 * so that each output slot's content type is narrowed to the covered spec
 * variants compatible with the corresponding input request's id.
 *
 * ## AbortSignal support
 *
 * The returned function accepts an optional `{ signal }` parameter. Signal
 * propagation follows the same model as {@link wrapProducer}:
 *
 * - The signal is forwarded to `cache.getMany()`. If the signal fires before
 *   the cache read completes, the function throws without contacting any
 *   producer for the non-bypass requests.
 *
 * - Once a producer must be called (for misses and bypass requests), no signal
 *   reaches the producer (because those calls may be shared with other callers
 *   via request collapsing) -- bulk producers take no `options` parameter at
 *   all, for the reason given in the `wrapProducer` JSDoc. The caller's wait is
 *   raced against the signal so they can bail out early, and the producers'
 *   results are always stored.
 *
 * - **Background refresh** (stale-while-revalidate): these calls are
 *   fire-and-forget and never receive a signal, since the caller has already
 *   been given a (stale) result.
 *
 * @param options - The cache to wrap, plus the wrapping behaviour; see
 *   {@link WrapProducerOptions}. `options.cache` is where values returned by
 *   the producer (see below) will actually be stored.
 *
 * @param producer - The function actually responsible for returning the
 *   results that will be sent to the user and/or stored in the cache. It is
 *   passed an array of requests (id and params) along with the callers' cache
 *   directives, and must return one result (or `ErrorType`) per request, in the
 *   same order. Pass a bare function to cover the whole registry and receive
 *   the full mixed batch, or {@link bulkProducerByIdType}'s result to dispatch
 *   per resource type.
