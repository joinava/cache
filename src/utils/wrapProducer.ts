 * store. A value-less phantom would leave the wrapper with no runtime source for
 * the covered set, since there are no record keys to read.
 *
 * ## Why the property is conditionally required
 *
 * It is optional when `Covered` is the whole registry -- that is what lets a
 * bare function be passed with no ceremony, and no runtime check is needed
 * there because the compiler already made the function prove it accepts every
 * registry id. It is REQUIRED when `Covered` is a strict subset, which makes
 * "narrowed coverage implies runtime proof of that narrowing" an invariant the
 * type system enforces rather than a convention.
 *
 * That requirement is what keeps coverage from having two sources that can
 * disagree. You might expect an explicit `Covered` type argument
 * (`wrapProducer<RT, "story">(...)`) to be enough to narrow coverage; it is
 * rejected precisely because it would narrow the TYPES while leaving the runtime
 * covered set absent, which the wrapper reads as "the whole registry". The types
 * still ban uncovered ids at the call site, so the gap is only reachable by
 * defeating them (a cast or a loosely-typed id -- see
 * {@link NoProducerForResourceTypeError}), but that is exactly the case that
 * error exists to catch: instead of throwing, the wrapper would hand the id to a
 * producer written for a different resource type and then store its content
 * under the incoming id. Routing partial coverage through
 * {@link producerByIdType}, which always supplies the runtime value, makes the
 * declared set and the reachable producers one and the same by construction.
 *
 * `Covered` still infers from the property even though it also appears in the
 * condition (probed, along with the deferred case where `Covered` is an
 * unresolved generic -- how the hashed-input wrappers forward theirs).
 *
 * Narrowing each result's `Id` to `IdOfResourceType<RT[Covered]>` bounds the
 * PRIMARY result to covered types only. Supplementals are unaffected: they are
 * a separate field typed over the full `SpecOf<RT>`, so a covered producer can
 * still attach supplementals for any registry type.

/**
 * Fundamentally, this function takes a producer that returns values (likely
 * without the help of a cache), and returns a function that's a drop-in
 * replacement for it, except that it tries to lookup and reuse prior
 * results from a cache, before calling the underlying user-provided producer.
 *
 * Exactly ONE producer function is passed, and it is the primitive:
 *
 * - A **bare function covers the whole registry.** `Covered` defaults to
 *   every registry type name, and the compiler makes the function prove it --
 *   its parameter must accept every registry id. Sole-type caches therefore
 *   just pass their producer.
 * - **Partial coverage requires {@link producerByIdType}**, which turns a
 *   per-resource-type record into a single function carrying its covered set
 *   in the optional {@link coveredTypes} property. `Covered` is inferred from
 *   that property (inference beats the default whenever it is present), which
 *   bounds the returned function's request type: it accepts exactly the
 *   covered types' ids, and requests for uncovered types are compile errors.
 *
 * A type with no producer in any wrapper is legal and normal: its entries are
 * written as other producers' supplemental resources (or direct `store()`
 * calls) and read via `Cache.get` -- the serve-if-present contract. Partial
 * coverage is also what makes capability-scoped and split wrappers honest: a
 * second `wrapProducer` call can cover a different subset of the same cache,
 * and adding a registry type grants no existing wrapper-holder fetch authority
 * over it.
 *
 * The wrapper calls `cache.classify(req.id)` once per request; the classify
 * result is what stamps `resourceType` on the `fetch`/`produce` diagnostics
 * messages. If the producer declared a covered set and the classified type is
 * not in it -- reachable only via a cast or loosely-typed id -- the wrapper
 * throws {@link NoProducerForResourceTypeError} before reading the cache. A
 * bare function declares no covered set, so that check is skipped entirely
 * (its coverage is the whole registry by construction).
 *
 * ## Producer purity contract
 *
 * A producer passed to any wrapper must be a side-effect-free read of its
 * resource type's origin: every invocation may be collapsed (shared with
 * other concurrent logical callers) and its result stored, so producer calls
 * are never 1:1 with callers. Requests "made for their side effects" should
 * not route through a wrapper at all; a consumer that must reach the origin
 * sends bypass directives (`maxAge: 0`); a producer whose response must not
 * be stored returns `storeFor: 0` directives.
 *
 * ## Bypass requests skip the cache read
 *
 * When the consumer's directives could never be satisfied by cached data
 * (`maxAge: 0`), the wrapper does not call `Cache.get` at all: `maxAge: 0`
 * structurally guarantees producer contact (closing the age-≤0/clock-skew
 * hole where a same-millisecond or future-dated entry has age ≤ 0 and would
 * satisfy `maxAge: 0` from cache), and bypass requests don't pollute the
 * `read` channel. Bypass requests still collapse (only with
 * identical-directive peers -- the collapse key includes directives) and
 * their results are still stored.
 *
 * Note that any supplemental resources returned by a producer will be
 * cached but not returned to the caller.
 *
 * The wrapped function is generic over the specific id of an incoming request
 * so that the result's content type is narrowed to the covered spec variants
 * compatible with that id.
 *
 * ## AbortSignal support
 *
 * The returned function accepts an optional `{ signal }` parameter. The
 * signal is forwarded to `cache.get()`, so the store read can be aborted. If
 * the signal fires before the cache read completes, the function throws
 * without ever contacting the producer. Once the cache read resolves and the
 * producer must be called, no signal reaches the producer -- because that call
 * may be sharing one underlying producer invocation with other callers who have
 * not aborted. Producers accordingly take **no** `options` parameter at all
 * (see {@link CoveringProducer}): every producer call goes through the
 * collapsed-invocation task, so there is never a single caller's signal that
 * could be forwarded without letting one caller cancel another's work. The
 * caller's wait for the producer result is instead **raced** against the signal,
 * so the caller can bail out immediately without waiting for the producer to
 * finish.
 *
 * Critically, bailing out does NOT prevent the producer's result from being
 * stored: the collapsed invocation always fires a (non-awaited)
 * `cache.store()` after the producer resolves, so the work is never wasted.
 * The trade-off is that the producer itself cannot observe the signal to
 * cancel its own in-progress work (e.g., an outgoing HTTP request).
 * Supporting that would require either (a) aborting the shared task only
 * when *all* callers have aborted, which adds significant complexity, or (b)
 * giving up request collapsing for callers that pass a signal, which would
 * defeat its purpose.
 *
 * @param options - The cache to wrap, plus the wrapping behaviour; see
 *   {@link WrapProducerOptions}. `options.cache` is where values returned by
 *   the producer (see below) will actually be stored.
 *
 * @param producer - The function actually responsible for returning the
 *   results that will be sent to the user and/or stored in the cache. It acts
 *   as the origin or "producer" for every resource type it covers. It is
 *   passed the request (id and params) along with the caller's cache
 *   directives, which may be needed in case the producer is itself backed by a
 *   cache, and it needs to decide whether to contact its origin. Pass a bare
 *   function to cover the whole registry, or {@link producerByIdType}'s result
 *   to cover a subset with one sub-producer per resource type.

  // Suppose the caller is requesting a resource, and we're already in the
  // process of requesting that resource from the producer (or storing the
  // response), and our pending request had the same id and the same params.
  // This can happen in practice, e.g.: a user signs in; that triggers 10 items
  // to load to show on home screen; but each of those 10 depend on some
  // cache-managed resource, so 10 requests hit the cache for that resource
  // essentially at once; one will start first, and the other 9 will be in the
  // situation of asking the cache to request data for which the same request is
  // already pending.
  //
  // In a situation like the above, what are we to do? Technically, it is
  // _posssible_ for the resource at the origin to change after the 10th request
  // came in to the cache, but before the origin's response to the cache's first
  // outbound request arrived. Therefore, there's an argument that the cache
  // technically should issue a new request to the origin for each of the 10
  // requests described in our hypothetical above.
  //
  // In practice, though, such behavior would risk bombarding the origin and
  // surprising users (who, by virtue of using a cache, might only be expecting
  // one request to the origin) for very little gain, as it's highly unlikely
  // that the resource will change at the origin just in the window of time that
  // the origin's response to an identical request is in transit.
  //
  // In other words, its not usually our job to add layers of caching that the
  // caller didn't ask for [which is what not hitting the origin 10 times would
  // be], but this case is special because the fact that the response hasn't
  // finished saving to the store yet means that, even if the user _does_ want
  // caching here (and they probably do), there's no directive they can use to
  // request it.
  //
  // So, here, we decide to keep track of the in-flight requests to the origin
  // (and their pending saves to the store), and, if there is an identical
  // request pending that was issued less than `collapseOverlappingRequestsTime`
  // seconds ago, we wait for and use the response of the already-pending
  // request, rather than issuing a new one. We make
  // `collapseOverlappingRequestsTime` configurable to placate any user worried
  // about the miniscule risk of inconsistency from this caching.
  //
  // We do this using the collapsedInvocationTaskCreator utility (the
  // metadata-carrying sibling of the public collapsedTaskCreator). That
  // utility does track the pending tasks in memory, so this optimzation will
  // be hindered a bit if the cache frontend is horizontally-scaled across
  // more than one server, but that's fine. We _could_ put this data in the
  // backing store, but that seems like it could create more race conditions?
  // And since batching identical requests at all is an optimization, putting
  // this in the store would probably be overkill.
  //
  // Finally, note is that we only collapse requests that target the same id
  // _with the same parameters_. If we didn't require the params to match, we
  // could get back a response to the first/pending request, only to find out
  // that it includes a `varyKeys` value that makes it unsuitable to serve the
  // second request (that we were trying to avoid making). So we'd have to add
  // fallback logic to handle actually issuing the second request in that case,
  // and that would be too much extra complexity to be worth it. We're in a
  // similar situation with directives, which must also match -- which is also
  // what keeps bypass (`maxAge: 0`) invocations from ever being shared with
  // plain-miss callers.
  //
  // No signal reaches the producer (`CoveringProducer` takes no options
  // parameter at all), because the
  // task may be shared with other callers who haven't aborted. It always
  // fires a (non-awaited) cache.store() after the producer resolves. This is
  // critical for the abort-signal design: since collapsed producer calls
  // don't receive a signal and can't be cancelled by individual callers, we
  // rely on the fact that the producer's work always flows into the cache --
  // ensuring it isn't wasted even when the caller that triggered it has

    // the store? Can the response update more than one entry? Can it update
    // things about it beyond reseting age to zero (e.g., changing the producer
    // directives)? Etc. For some HTTP context, see
    // https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.3.4 For invalidation, the
    // idea would be to somehow let request A passing through the producer
    // trigger the invalidation of other cached results [a la a POST
    // invalidating a GET in HTTP], but how? Call a user-provided invalidate
    // function and pass it the just-made request, the promise for its response,
    // and the entry store, and can delete entries made invalid by the request
    // that just passed through?

    // signal so they can bail out immediately. The underlying producer task
    // keeps running and its result is stored via the collapsed invocation.

    // instead rides an invocation already in flight, that invocation's
