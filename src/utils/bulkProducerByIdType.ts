/**
 * @fileoverview Per-resource-type dispatch for BULK producers: the bulk
 * counterpart of `producerByIdType`, and the sub-producer vocabulary that only
 * this helper's callers speak.
 *
 * Split from the wrapper for the same reason the single helper is: routing a
 * batch to sub-producers is a function of the resource-type registry's `matches`
 * guards and nothing else, so a by-id-type bulk producer is a value in its own
 * right -- buildable, drivable and testable before any cache exists.
 *
 * Routing itself is imported from `producerByIdType` rather than reimplemented,
 * which is what keeps the two helpers' answers to "is this id covered" from
 * drifting apart. The edge back to `wrapBulkProducer` is **type-only** (its
 * `CoveringBulkProducer` return shape and its id-erased `LooseBulkProducer`), as
 * is `wrapBulkProducer`'s edge to the sub-producer type here, so the runtime
 * import graph stays acyclic in both directions.

 * The result type is a flat array of (RequestPairedProducerResult |

/**
 * The bulk counterpart of `producerByIdType`: sugar over `wrapBulkProducer`'s
 * single-producer primitive that turns a record with one bulk producer per
 * covered resource type into ONE function, and declares its covered set in
 * {@link coveredTypes} so the wrapper can both infer `Covered` from it and
 * enforce it at runtime.
 *
 * Use it when each resource type has its own origin, or to cover a strict
 * subset of the registry. Skip it -- pass a bare function -- when the producer
 * wants the full mixed batch, which is the capability the single-function form
 * exists for.
 *
 * Behaviour on each invocation:
 *
 * - The incoming batch is split by classifying each `req.id` against the
 *   registry, remembering every request's ORIGINAL index, and each sub-producer
 *   is invoked once, concurrently, with its own slice.
 * - Results are reassembled **positionally**: slice position `j` maps back to
 *   that request's original index. Positional is forced, not chosen: a batch
 *   can legitimately contain the same id twice with different `params`, so the
 *   id is not a routing key.
 * - A sub-producer's **failure** -- a rejection, or a synchronous throw from a
 *   non-async sub-producer -- is caught and written into that type's slots as
 *   `Error` elements, so per-request error isolation survives the merge, and one
 *   type's failure never discards a sibling type's results. It lives in the
 *   sugar rather than in the wrapper.
 * - A sub-producer whose result count does not match the slice it was given --
 *   in EITHER direction -- fails the whole invocation, naming that resource type
 *   and both counts. Both directions mean the sub-producer disagrees with the
 *   slice it was handed, so its positional pairing is no longer trustworthy, and
 *   catching it here is what makes the error name the offending sub-producer;
 *   the wrapper's equivalent check sees only the merged batch and can report a
 *   total at best. (This is stricter than the wrapper, which does not police a
 *   bare producer's over-return.) Padding the missing slots with `Error`s
 *   instead would turn a contract violation into a per-request failure and hide
 *   the bug.
 *
 * Requests routed through this helper are classified twice, for the reason
 * given on `producerByIdType`.
 *
 * Throws at construction on an empty record.
 *
 * @param resourceTypes - The registry the producer's ids will be classified
 *   against: `cache.resourceTypes` for the cache it will be wrapped against.
 *   See `producerByIdType` for why the registry and not the cache.
 * @param producers - One {@link BulkResourceTypeProducer} per covered resource
 *   type; `Covered` is inferred from the keys.
