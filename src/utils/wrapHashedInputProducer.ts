/**
 * ## Hashed-input producers vs. (plain) producers
 *
 * `wrapProducer`/`wrapBulkProducer` model a cache as a **lookup of a mutable
 * entity by its id**: the caller already has the id, and the cached value is a
 * function of that id and time (e.g. "the current `User` for `user:123`"). The
 * id is the natural cache key, so the producer receives it directly.
 *
 * `wrapHashedInputProducer`/`wrapBulkHashedInputProducer` model the other common
 * case: the cached value is an **expensive-to-compute function of some input**,
 * reused whenever the same input recurs (e.g. an LLM extraction over a chunk of
 * text, a rendered template, a compiled artifact). Here the *input* is the
 * identity of the work, so a hash of the input is the natural cache key — but
 * the producer wants the original, un-hashed input to actually do the
 * computation. These wrappers encapsulate exactly that: a `hashInput` derives
 * the cache id from an input and a `produce` takes the full input, and the
 * wrapper keeps the input around just long enough to hand it over on a miss,
 * otherwise behaving like `wrapProducer` / `wrapBulkProducer` (same caching,
 * request-collapsing, stale-while-revalidate, abort, and diagnostics behavior;
 * see {@link WrapProducerOptions}).
 *
 * ## One resource type, or several
 *
 * A cache with one resource type needs nothing but the two functions:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const compute = wrapHashedInputProducer({ cache, hashInput, produce });
 * ```
 *
 * For several, {@link hashedInputProducerByInputType} builds a *hashed-input producer* —
 * one `.when` per covered resource type, dispatching on the input — and the
 * wrapper takes that instead:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const compute = wrapHashedInputProducer({ cache, hashedInputProducer });
 * ```
 *
 * A hashed-input producer is built with **no cache**: it is a value in its own right,
 * constructible (and reusable) before any cache exists, and checked against a
 * cache's registry only where the two are wired together. Coverage is whatever
 * the chain added — any non-empty subset of the registry.
 *
 * ## Minted ids
 *
 * Because hashed-input ids are hashes, the registry's in-band-discriminator
 * requirement falls on `hashInput`: a branch's `hashInput` must mint ids that
 * its resource type's `matches` guard accepts. That is checked twice. At compile
 * time, wiring a hashed-input producer to a cache compares each branch's minted-id
 * type against its variant's `IdOfResourceType`. At runtime, each hashed id is
 * classified before it is used for anything, and a mismatch throws
 * `UnclassifiableIdError`/`AmbiguousResourceTypeError` naming the branch — the
 * backstop for a mint that reached the wrapper through a cast or an untyped
 * boundary. For accept-everything registries the runtime check is vacuous (the
 * guard accepts every id), and the compile-time one carries the weight.
 *
 * The single-producer form declares no resource type, so there is no name to
 * check a mint against; classifying the id at all is the whole runtime check
 * there.
 *
 * ## Supplemental resources: input-keyed or id-keyed
 *
 * Like plain producers, a hashed-input producer can return `supplementalResources`
 * — values it produced as a byproduct that are worth caching. They come in
 * two forms, distinguished by which key is present:
 *
 * - **Input-keyed** (`{ input, content, … }`): identified by the input the
 *   value would be computed from. The wrapper routes the input through the
 *   same `matchesInput` branch selection it applies to call-time inputs,
 *   hashes it with the routed branch's `hashInput` (so any COVERED branch
 *   can be the target, not just the producing one), and mint-checks the
 *   result against that branch's type — a bad mint rejects the invocation
 *   loudly, naming the branch. A later `compute(thatInput)` finds the entry
 *   as a cache hit. In a hashed-input producer these are correlated per variant:
 *   the `input` and `content` must come from the SAME variant, so "computing a
 *   collection also caches its stories" is checked rather than merely allowed.
 * - **Id-keyed** (`{ id, content, … }`, a plain {@link ProducerResultResource}):
 *   for ANY registry type, covered or not — exactly what plain producers'
 *   supplementals are. Classified by their own id at store time. This is what
 *   makes these wrappers full peers of `wrapProducer` when the hash exists for
 *   **key privacy** rather than for expensive computation: derive the primary
 *   key by hashing, and still supplementally store other resources under their
 *   natural ids. Typing these needs the registry's id space, which
 *   the single-producer form has; a (cache-free) hashed-input producer must be
 *   declared with the registry's `SpecOf` to return them — see
 *   {@link hashedInputProducerByInputType}.
 *

/**
 * A reference-counted registry mapping a derived cache id back to the input it
 * was hashed from, so the internal producer can recover the input on a miss.
 *
 * Reference counting (rather than a plain set/delete) is required because of
 * request collapsing: several concurrent calls for the same input derive the
 * same id and may share a single producer call. If the first caller to settle
 * deleted the entry, a still-in-flight caller (or the shared producer call)
 * could find it missing. Each call `acquire`s on the way in and `release`s in a
 * `finally`; the entry is dropped only when the last holder releases it. This
 * keeps the map bounded (unlike a process-lifetime map), since nothing is
 * retained past the calls that need it.
 *
 * Soundness of "release after the wrapped call settles": the underlying
 * `wrapProducer`/`wrapBulkProducer` invoke the producer *synchronously* while
 * the wrapped call is still running (including the fire-and-forget
 * stale-while-revalidate refresh), and our internal producer reads the input as
 * its first, synchronous step — so the read always happens before the release.
